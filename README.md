# Vega

Vega is a free and open source scanner and testing platform to test the security
of web applications. Vega can help you find and validate SQL Injection, Cross-Site
Scripting (XSS), inadvertently disclosed sensitive information, and other
vulnerabilities. It is written in Java, GUI based, and runs on Linux, OS X, and
Windows. 

Vega includes an automated scanner for quick tests and an intercepting proxy for
tactical inspection. The Vega scanner finds XSS (cross-site scripting), SQL
injection, and other vulnerabilities. Vega can be extended using a powerful API
in the language of the web: Javascript. 

Vega was developed by [Subgraph](http://subgraph.com/) in Montreal.
